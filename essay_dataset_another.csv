0,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," While time spent at college is a happy experience for most, the university life is not without its rough patches. Starting university is like starting a new life. Everyone’s situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost all college students deal with at least once during their time at university. In my opinion, homesickness, social problems and time management are among the most important sufferings of university life. The first year of university is always extra hard and most students will at one point get homesick and depressed, especially those who attend a university far away from their hometown. Freshmen suffer more, as it is presumably their first year away from their home, family and friends. If a student is lucky enough, he/she will make many new friends, because establishing connections and spending time with friends is important for building community. Otherwise, it will be more difficult for the student to go through the university period with all its other difficulties. University is academically challenging. The courses require much more effort and planning than high school classes. Most students do not have enough time to manage their activities. They sleep erratically and do everything at the last minute; that is what leads them to an unhealthy and unplanned life. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted, depressed and end up dropping out of university.",7.0,7.5,7.5,7.5
1,What are the characteristics of bad teachers?," Bad teachers, for sure, are one of the main reasons why students hate school. These kinds of teachers often don’t have organization skills and class management and this way they turn school into a frustrating and embarrassing environment. In my opinion, the inability to communicate with students is another characteristic of bad teachers. If a teacher doesn’t have the ability to teach, all he/she can do is reading from his/her pre-prepared notes without mastering it. This way, he/she isn’t even able to answer the students’ questions. Class management is one of the most important factors that affects class order. If the teacher isn’t able to run the class, chaos will prevent him/her from teaching well. In such a case, the task of establishing classroom order falls to the students who are selected as the group leader by the teacher. Communication is also essential. Bad teachers who aren’t able to establish friendly relation with students, create an unpleasant atmosphere for them. Not being able to establish an intimate relationship, the teacher can’t make a good impression on students and provide a suitable environment for better teaching; so even the smartest students won’t be able to learn subjects well. School is one of the most important organs in which a person spends many hours of the day. Therefore, in the first place, teachers must have the ability of teaching and truly love their job and students in order to make school a good environment for education.",8.0,8.0,7.5,8.0
2,What are the characteristics of bad teachers?," Certainly, bad teachers can be one of the main reasons why students hate school. These kinds of teachers can make school such a frustrating, embarrassing and a bad experience. I, personally, believe that out of all the bad characteristics a teacher can have, lack of classroom management, knowledge and commitment are among the worst that deprive students of better learning conditions. Class management can be the demise of any bad teacher no matter their intentions. If a teacher cannot control their students, they will not be able to teach them effectively. Being a good classroom manager starts on day one. A lack of classroom management is probably the single biggest downfall of a bad teacher. Unfortunately, there are some teachers who do not know the content well enough to teach it. This is an area that could be overcome through preparation. All teachers should thoroughly prepare for any lesson before they teach it to make sure they understand what they are going to be teaching. Teachers will lose credibility with their students quickly if they do not know what they are teaching. Of all the bad characteristics a bad teacher may have, non-commitment seems to be the worst. Not being commitment, teachers spend the minimum amount of time necessary to do their job never arriving early or staying late. They do not challenge their students and there is no creativity in their teaching. This destructive characteristic can easily kill motivation in students. There is no such thing as a perfect teacher, but since school is one of the most basic and important organs in which students spend most of their time, there is no doubt that teachers have a tremendous impact on them, so they must be experienced, committed, capable, and most importantly, love their job and their students.",8.0,8.5,8.5,8.5
3,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," The power of money in solving important and fundamental problems of life is transient and permanent. There is a general belief, especially among poor people, that every problem can be solved by money. Having money is great; It is true that the role of it, in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that it is primitive and wrong to think that money is the solution to all problems, because there are some disease-related and emotion-based problems that cannot be met through money. There are various incurable and sometimes fatal diseases, which unfortunately cannot be cured even by paying a large amount of money. Diseases such as diabetes, AIDS, some cancers, mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and autism have yet to be cured. Many people, all over the world, suffer from such diseases, but money cannot save or cure them. Not only physical illnesses but also many mental and emotional problems cannot be solved with money. For someone who feels lonely, money does not accompany or for those who suffer from depression, money does not bring happiness. There are those who got divorced and unfortunately no amount of money can ever fix relations between people. There are many mental and emotional problems that money can never solve. Overall, Money is just a tool which is used for living and making things easier, however, in fact, it does not solve all problems. Money will sort out financial stresses a person may have, but obviously it cannot buy him/her happiness and will not sort out all emotional and pathological problems; definitely it cannot buy a person contentment with his/herself. So, money may lessen problems, but it does not solve all.",9.0,9.0,8.5,9.0

5,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," Studying at university will certainly be fraught with problems that students will have to deal with. In my opinion, conditions are naturally more difficult for those who study in a city other than their hometown. The most important problems of these students, in addition to the cost of education, are accommodation and homesickness. Each student has to prepare relevant books to study in any field. Fortunately, nowadays, due to the development of technology and easier access to the Internet, students are able to purchase books for free or buy them at a lower price. Students, who live in dormitories, have group life; some items such as bathroom and kitchen are shared between them, which makes it hard for some of these students to endure university life. In my opinion, living in dormitories is one of the main reasons which causes homesickness, boredom and unhappiness. For students who have left their hometown to study, it is most of the times annoying to be away from their family and friends. Just as advances in technology have minimized the enormous cost of preparing books for students, so too have advances made it possible for them to communicate with families and friends more easily than before, which mostly relieves their homesickness. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted and dropping out of university is the least of the consequences.",6.0,6.5,6.5,6.5

7,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," In today’s modern world, money plays a major role in men’s lives. Some people think that the most important basic human’s needs such as food, clothing and housing can be solved by money. But I personally believe that in some cases, the acquisition of various sciences and human’s health, can’t be met through money. It’s true that the study of science, like many other activities, is possible with money in the first place; but not all those who have an educational document are literate. Paying a large sum of money, some people are able to obtain a counterfeit document and they even think that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth. However, experience is not something that can be bought; Only with many studies and during many years, human beings achieve their desired knowledge and experience. Before education, food, clothing, and material needs in general, men need health indeed. Only a healthy person can continue studying, working, and ultimately surviving. There are cases in which diseases afflict human beings at exorbitant costs, and those people who are unable to pay these costs say goodbye to life. But this is only one part of the story; there are other cases in which the disease is incurable. Take the present age as an example; human beings have been infected with an unknown virus that even so much wealth cannot save them. Money is actually important; it has always been helping people in many ways. But it can never be considered the cure for all problems. It’s better to consider money as a complement to men’s health, prudence, knowledge and experience for a better life.",8.0,8.0,7.5,8.0

9,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," I choose temperate climate for living in a place. Temperate climate has more advantages than other climate and cold and warm weather has many disadvantages that they are not exist in mild or temperate climate. Because of these reasons that I explain each of them, I prefer temperate climate. There are numerous advantages for temperate climate. Countries with mild climate usually have four seasons and their beauties. People enjoy from watching the nature of the earth, for example: the spring’s flowers views the summer’s fruites, the fall’s colourfull trees view, fall’s rain and snowy wheather in winter. Another season’s beauties is existence of special and tasty fruits in every season severally, specially in summer such as water melon, peach, cheery, fig and so on; There are pomegranate, persimmon, and etc in fall and greengage, strawberry are spring popular friutes. If we have four season and temperate climate country , we will enjoy from some special sports which are in winter such as mountaineering, skiing and which are in summer such as swimming, fishing, and etc. Whatching and felling nature’s beauties in every season is a strong and good reason for living in temperate climate. Living in cold or warm climate have some problems and disadvantages that many people do not prefer to live in that. Some people have their special body nature who can not live in very cold or very warm weather because they may be sick. Catch cold in cold climate and heatstroke in very warm and sultry climate are very common. In very cold climate people usually are depressed and sad because the sun shines less and they usually have lack of vitamin D. The apartments should have advanced facilities for raising or reducing the temperature both in cold climate and warm climate, otherwise they usually worry about gas cut off and power outage. Totally very cold or very hot climate offend the citizens of the cities or the countries. The mild and temperate climate is suitable for living in everywhere. In temperate climate, we do not have any speciall worry or fear about lack of some thing to survive; we can enjoy from season’s beauties. Altogether, I think mild climate has many advantages where is reasonable for living.",7.5,7.5,7.0,7.5
10,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," If I want to choose a climate for living in the place or in a city, I will choose a mild climate.

Hot wheather isn’t good wheather for living. Some body because their body nature can’t live in that and they may become ill . in very hot weather we need advanced stuff for reducing the temperature of the atmosphere.",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0
11,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," In today’s world, money plays an important role in human’s lives. Some people think that the most important basic human needs such as food, clothing and housing can be solved by money. But I believe that more major needs, such as human’s health and learning different sciences, cannot always be met through money. Men really need health before education, food, clothing and material needs. Only a healthy person can continue studying, working and eventually surviving. Sometimes the cost of treating some diseases is so high that not everyone can afford it, so they suffer the disease and eventually die. But there are other cases in which the disease is incurable that not even great wealth can save human beings. It’s true that studying, like many other things, in the first place is possible with money; but not all those who have an educational document are literate; some people are able to obtain a forged document by paying lots of money and believe that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth. However, experience is not something that can be bought, it’s gained during the time by studying a lot. Money is important; it’s always been helping people in many ways, but it can never be considered the cure for all problems. It’s better to consider money as a help along with human’s health and experience.",8.0,7.0,7.5,7.5

The second characteristic of a bad teacher is lack of professionalism. Ineffective teachers are often absent. They may fallow a bad way of dressing uniform, and also they use inappropriate language in their classroom. Briefly, a professional behavior shows you take your responsibilities seriously.

There are some teachers who do not know the content well enough to teach it. All teachers should prepare for any lesson before teaching.

Bad teacher with lack of commitment, do not challenge students. There is no creativity in their teaching. In summary, bad teachers who lack of commitment, do not take their job serious.

In short, because the bad teachers lack the ability to encourage learners, they are known as ineffective educators. Third, lack of professionalism can quickly lead a teacher’s dismissal. Teachers who are routinely absent or tardy are ineffective. They cannot do their job if they are not there to do it. Briefly, a professional behavior shows you take your responsibilities seriously.

It is the only planet which has desirable features for living of human; it has oxygen, ocean of water and of course climate change. It may happened that we have experienced different types of weather such as cold, hot or temperate.

If you want to have a healthy heart and an amazing life, try to live in the cold climate. To summarize, living in the cold weather is a good option for having a heart which works properly. Second, although catching cold is still likely during cold weather, you are free from many diseases and virus that are common during warmer temperature.

19,It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Choosing whether or not to go to university is an important decision, and ultimately it could boil down to one simple question: “Is it worth going to university?” I strongly disagree with the idea that going to university has no value anymore for three main reasons. By going to university you can get more knowledge in a specific area, you can obtain valuable experiences, and also you can become more independent.

20,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Money is an extremely valuable and essential tool in our modern society. It is absolutely important and will solve many problems that we have in our life. On the other hand, I think there are many things that are indispensable and play important roles in our life such as happiness, forgiveness, and humanity. On one side of argument, there are people who believe that money has a major role to play in the life of human. Undoubtedly money is required to buy anything. You can buy luxury and also modern things which can bring comfortable life for you. Thus, if you want a life of luxury, without money, it would be very difficult to live a comfortable life and hence it is easy to understand why people work very hard these days to earn money. This point of view about money which can solve all the problems leads to only one conclusion that money is an extremely valuable tool in the modern life. It is absolutely important and solve many problems and because of that people work hard for many hours to earn money for solving their problems and have comfortable life. On the other side of the argument, some people believe that there are many things which are the most important such as happiness, forgiveness, and also humanity. Having money is good but expecting that it can solve all the problems is completely wrong. I believe happiness and the ability of forgiveness are the most important factors that can solve the problems and can make worth living. If you learn how to be happy and also how to forgive others then you have achieved everything in your life. If you are depressed and not balanced in your life, what is the use of millions in your bank account? Money cannot buy everlasting life. It cannot buy you good health, a life of free disease such as cancer, heart disease, etc. It cannot also buy humanity, although in the modern life money means many things. When we understand the reason of creating human, we can conclude money is just one of the tools that will help human for having better life. In conclusion, in the modern society with complex problems money and earning more is very important but it cannot solve all problems. Money is good, but just ask yourself what other things can solve your problems? To recapitulate, there many things in our life which are irreplaceable and you cannot exchange them with money. We live in a world that is surrounded by positive characteristics. Few of us think that money is everything and can solve all problems, but I personally believe money has a minor effect on our life.",6.0,6.5,6.5,6.5
21,What are the characteristics of bad teachers?," We will hope that all teachers are excellent, and effective persons. Students have all experienced good and bad teachers. What qualities can consider a teacher ineffective or bad? I think bad teachers may have three characteristics; they lack of classroom management, lack of motivation skills, and also lack of professionalism. First, lack of classroom management is the probably the biggest failure of a bad teacher. When a teacher does not have the ability to control students in the classroom, he or she cannot create effective opportunities for transferring information students. Simply, if teachers cannot manage pupils in their classroom they will not be able to teach them effectively. In conclusion, classroom management plays an important role in teaching profession. Lack of classroom management skills influences teaching and learning. Second, bad teachers do not the abilities to create an environment which can motivate learners and as the consequence they demotivate their students. Sometimes it happens that children lose their motivation for learning because they do not receive any attentions from their teachers. In short, because the bad teachers lack the ability to encourage learners, they are known as ineffective educators. Third, lack of professionalism can quickly lead a teacher’s dismissal. Teachers who are routinely absent or tardy are ineffective. They cannot do their job if they are not there to do it. Briefly, a professional behavior shows you take your responsibilities seriously. Failing to act professionally sets a bad example and may cause you to lose the trust and respect of students. To recapitulate, we as a student wishes that all teachers are perfect. But it happens that pupils have bad educators too. An unprofessional teacher who does not have classroom management skills, ability to motivate, and lack professionalism can adversely affect the attitude of students toward learning and teaching.",7.5,8.0,8.0,8.0

25,It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Choosing whether or not go to university is a massive decision, and ultimately it could down to one simple question; “Is it worth going to university?” I strongly disagree with the idea that going to university has no value anymore for two main reasons. By going to university you can get more knowledge in the specific area, and also you can get value experiences. The first reason for going to university is to get the higher education and to gain knowledge in an area which is essential for your future job. For example, a popular belief is that if you do not have a degree, or if you do not have specific knowledge and skill in the proper are, you will not receive proper job in the future. In short, people attend to university to study in specific area and as consequence they will find desirable job in the future. The second reason for going to university is that you get valuable experience through the study. Going to university is very different from high school; it is just like starting a new life in a new environment. You will learn adopt and take responsibility for everything to do. To sum up, by attending to university you have experienced a new life and prepare yourself for future responsibilities.

26,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," In today’s world, money plays an important role in human’s lives. Some people think that the most important basic human needs such as food, clothing and housing can be solved by money. But I believe that more major needs, such as human’s health and learning different sciences, cannot always be met through money. Men really need health before education, food, clothing and material needs. Only a healthy person can continue studying, working and eventually surviving. Sometimes the cost of treating some diseases is so high that not everyone can afford it, so they suffer the disease and eventually die. But there are other cases in which the disease is incurable that not even great wealth can save human beings. It’s true that studying, like many other things, in the first place is possible with money; but not all those who have an educational document are literate; some people are able to obtain a forged document by paying lots of money and believe that they have achieved what they wanted with wealth. However, experience is not something that can be bought, it’s gained during the time by studying a lot. Money is important; it’s always been helping people in many ways, but it can never be considered the cure for all problems. It’s better to consider money as a help along with human’s health and experience.",5.5,6.5,6.0,6.0
27,It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," As long as the world around us has become modern, people prefer not to get married and stay single all over their lives. Many years ago, the main reason for marriage was the continuation of human’s generation. Nowadays it’s not that important to have an heir; people don’t have that much money to leave for the future! The main obstacle is financial problems; house, a suitable job, food and clothing for children. It’s too hard to earn money for a daily normal life just for one person, let alone a family! If we give up the financial problems and focus on the mental aspect of this issue, obviously we see that by developing the knowledge, psychologists found out that if men and women live together, they can better solve their problems, feel less alone, complete each other and actually live happily ever after. This may be true, but in most today’s lives, the man has the power and is the breadwinner of the house, but the woman is a cook for the family or a nurse for the children; an obedient for his husband! So, it’s clear that being single can bring a person, especially a woman, more happiness. Even if cohabitation starts with love, but sometimes the financial and mental aspects outweigh the love. There is also other reason because of which people prefer to be single; for example, these days, to feel more free, people live alone and independent of their family. On the other hand, for filling their loneliness, some of them take care of a pet. Maybe they think keeping a pet costs them less than having a child, or maybe they seem more modern and classier! I don’t agree with being single and keeping pets in order to escape from loneliness, but despite all the problems that I, as a woman, may face in my single life, I believe that marriage deprives humans’ freedom by making commitment; men and women are forced to give up their own purposes by working hard all the time in today’s society to stay alive.",6.5,6.5,6.5,6.5

32,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," Cold, warm, or temperate climate, it may happen you have experienced these climates in the different seasons. I prefer to live the cold weather because in the cold weather you burn more calories, it can alleviate you outdoor allergies, and it can strengthen your heart. Burning more calories is the first advantage of living in the cold weather. When it is cold, your body works harder to maintain your core temperature. So your body use a considerable amount of energy to keep you warm, and humidify the air you breathe when you are out in the cold.

On the other hand, I think there are many things that are indispensable and play important roles in our life such as happiness, forgiveness, and humanity. On one side of argument, there are people who believe that money has a major role to play in the life of human. Undoubtedly money is required to buy anything. You can buy luxury and also modern things which can bring comfortable life for you. Thus, if you want a life of luxury, without money, it would be very difficult to live a comfortable life and hence it is easy to understand why people work very hard these days to earn money.

34,"What kind of climate do you prefer to live in? Cold, warm, or temperate? Why?"," Climate is one of the most important options which must be considered before choosing an environment for living. Because not only does it affect other environmental conditions, but also the mood of the inhabitants of a region. The question is which climate can be better for living. I personally prefer living in temperate climate. Such climatic condition brings pristine nature with excellent landscapes, pleasant weather and consequently greater food diversity. It is worth mentioning that the inhabitants of temperate regions are warm and friendly. Beautiful nature and nice weather are the blessings that include the people of temperate climates. A temperate climate has the four distinct seasons: Warm summer, cold winter, autumn and spring. Rain and fertile soil, that pave the way for more plant growth, are the benefits of this climate. Wherever the plants grow, fresh air is found too. Take the north of Iran as an example, there are plants everywhere because of the rain, summers are not too hot and winters are not too cold, and the climate is great for living in this region. As I mentioned before, the temperate climate has a great impact on the nature of an environment, and food comes from nature. Rich food in the temperate environment is obtained more and easier. Let’s go back to the previous example; In addition to the unique nature, the cities in north of Iran have the most varied, fresh and delicious foods. After all, the weather affects inhabitants as much as it affects the environment. Residents of temperate regions are relatively happy, warm-hearted and friendly. They do not resemble the inhabitants of cold regions, who are generally sad and unfriendly, or the inhabitants of warm regions, who are quick-tempered. Finally, it should be noted that what I have mentioned are just some of the benefits of choosing a temperate climate for living; this climate and its benefits can only be well understood when we experience living in it and witness with our own eyes the beauty of its nature, the diversity of its food and the intimacy of its residents.",9.0,8.5,8.5,8.5

38,It is possible to be single for all your life and be happy. We do not need to get married. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, satisfaction and also fulfillment. Happiness may become dependent on someone else, or by doing or obtaining something. But when you understand the definition of happiness clearly and embody it, you make better decisions and consequently your life become enriched. Although it is possible to be single for all your life and be happy, I disagree with this idea. I believe with a good marriage, which has some characteristics such as empathy, forgiveness, trustfulness, and also respect, you can be happy and make a happy life. Empathy is the ability to relate to how someone else is feeling; in fact to be able to put yourself in their shoes. It is crucial for any marriage to survive with some weaknesses, as it is an essential part of truly understanding another person. When you understand your partner in difficult situations, for example, you feel his or her reactions too. In a word, by truly understanding another person, you can be happy and enjoy your life. Another factor for being happy with marriage is forgiveness. Obviously, forgiveness means you forgive the fault s of your partner in the life but not always. When you look back and recall all mistakes in your life, you inject the bad feelings and also unhappiness emotions in your mind. In brief, by forgiveness in your life, you liberate yourself form any bad feelings and bring joyfulness in your life. A further fact that I think with a good marriage we can be happy too is trustfulness. Basically, trust means you have a strong feeling and also belief in honest of someone. I believe mutual connection can bring trust in your maternal life. Honest is the quality o always speaking the truth and being transparent in your words and actions. When you say what you want directly, you relaxed yourself in your life and make happy moments with your partner. In brief, honesty in a relationship means always telling your partner the truth and being totally open with them. The final reason for being happy with marriage is respect. Respect means a deep understanding of thought, reactions, and opinions. By accepting that you married with person with all his or her weakness and strengths, you make respect in your life. It is better to clarify your wants from your married life. In short, respect means you accept your partner and try to make your life based on admiration that can bring happiness. To recapitulate, it is possible to have the times when you are single, but with the good marriage you can strength happiness too. Marriage means you accept your new life with your partner and try to be happy.",7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0

These days people live alone and independent of their family, because this way they can be more free. And for filling their lonliness, some of them take care of a pet. Maybe they think keeping a pet costs them less than having a child! I don’t agree with being single and keeping pets in order to escape from loneliness, but despite all the problems that I, as a woman, may face in my single life, I believe that marriage deprives humans’ freedom by making commitment; men and women are forced to give up their own purposes by working hard all the time in today’s society to stay alive.",6.5,6.0,6.5,6.5
40,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," These days, people’s life is more complex, hard, and there are some problems in it. Besides this human try to work hard to earn more money. Although some people believe money can solve all problems in the life, I disagree with it. Having money is good but expecting that it can solve the all problem is completely wrong. I believe happiness and the ability of forgiveness are the more factors that can solve the problems and can make worth living. If you learn how to be happy and also how to forgive others then you have achieved everything in your life. If you are depressed and not balanced in your life, what is the use of millions in your bank account? To conclude, money is good but it is not everything. In addition, money cannot solve all the problems of humanity. Although in the modern life it means many things. When we understand the reason of creating human, we can conclude money is one of the tools that will help human for having better life. Similarly, money is an extremely valuable tool in the newest society. It is absolutely important but it does not solve all of our problems. Money cannot buy you everlasting life. It cannot buy you good health, a life of free of disease such as cancer, heart disease, etc. In conclusion, in the modern society with complex problems money plays an important role but it cannot solve all problems. I would never say money is useless, just ask yourself, excepting money, what other things can solve your problems in the life?",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

It may happened that we have experienced different types of weather such as cold, hot or temperate.

If you want to have a healthy heart and an amazing life, try to live in the cold climate. To summarize, living in the cold weather is a good option for having a heart which works properly.

Starting university is like starting a new life. There are various challenges that every student inevitably struggles with during university life, which most students are not prepared for and end up being overwhelmed. In my opinion, among all these problems, difficulty in social communicating and time management are common to all students. The inability to communicate socially in a larger and newer environment than school can be the first problem which some students, especially freshmen and shy ones, face. Inability to find friends and communicate with classmates can lead to problems such as depression. For this reason, if a student takes the first step well, he/she can deal with some of the other problems more easily.

For many, college courses require much more effort; from trying to study to living alone and doing the required chores, most of the students are not able to manage and think about their time and do not have enough concentration due to lack of sleep because they do not have enough time to do their activities. Proper planning is the most important action that a student can take to reduce irregularities. Naturally, every student faces difficulties in university life which he/she has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well.

Countries with mild climate usually have four seasons and their beauties. People enjoy from watching the nature of the earth, for example: the spring’s flowers views the summer’s fruites, the fall’s colourfull trees view, fall’s rain and snowy wheather in winter. Another season’s beauties is existence of special and tasty fruits in every season severally, specially in summer such as water melon, peach, cheery, fig and so on; There are pomegranate, persimmon, and etc in fall and greengage, strawberry are spring popular friutes. If we have four season and temperate climate country , we will enjoy from some special sports which are in winter such as mountaineering, skiing and which are in summer such as swimming, fishing, and etc. Whatching and felling nature’s beauties in every season is a strong and good reason for living in temperate climate. Living in cold or warm climate have some problems and disadvantages that many people do not prefer to live in that.

There is a general belief, especially among poor people, that every problem can be solved by money. Having money is great; It is true that the role of it, in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that it is primitive and wrong to think that money is the solution to all problems, because there are some disease-related and emotion-based problems that cannot be met through money. There are various incurable and sometimes fatal diseases, which unfortunately cannot be cured even by paying a large amount of money. Diseases such as diabetes, AIDS, some cancers, mental illnesses such as schizophrenia and genetic diseases such as Down syndrome and autism have yet to be cured. Many people, all over the world, suffer from such diseases, but money cannot save or cure them. Not only physical illnesses but also many mental and emotional problems cannot be solved with money. For someone who feels lonely, money does not accompany or for those who suffer from depression, money does not bring happiness. There are those who got divorced and unfortunately no amount of money can ever fix relations between people. There are many mental and emotional problems that money can never solve. Overall, Money is just a tool which is used for living and making things easier, however, in fact, it does not solve all problems. Money will sort out financial stresses a person may have, but obviously it cannot buy him/her happiness and will not sort out all emotional and pathological problems; definitely it cannot buy a person contentment with his/herself.

In the conclusion, I prefer to live in the not very cold and not very warm weather. But first I should pay attention to the outcomes of this type weather and then chose the life style for it.",5.0,5.5,5.0,5.0
61,Money can solve all problems. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," There is a general belief, especially among poor people, that every problem can be met through money. It is true that the role of money in meeting some basic human needs is undeniable, but I personally believe that money is not the solution to all problems, because more fundamental problems such as diseases and emotion-related problems cannot be solved by money. There are many incurable diseases that can never be cured, no matter how much money you have. For example, many genetic diseases; such as autism, many mental illnesses; such as schizophrenia, or some other diseases; such as cancer, have yet to be cured and even paying millions of money will not be able to save patients from death. There are also various mental and emotional problems that money cannot solve. Take loneliness as an example; One can never get rid of loneliness or find true and everlasting friends for himself/herself with money. Some people also mistakenly believe that money brings happiness to them, but this kind of happiness, that comes with money, is transient and false and real happiness is never achieved with having more amount of money. Sadly, no amount of money can ever fix relations between people and emotional crises. Money can sort out financial stresses a person may have, but it cannot buy a person happiness and solve all disease-related problems. It is just a tool which is used for living easier; so, money may lessen problems, but it does not solve all.",9.0,8.5,8.5,8.5
62,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," While time spent at college is a happy experience for most, the university life is not without its rough patches. Starting university is like starting a new life. Everyone’s situation is unique, but there are a few problems that almost all college students deal with at least once during their time at university. In my opinion, homesickness, social problems and time management are among the most important sufferings of university life. The first year of university is always extra hard and most students will at one point get homesick and depressed, especially those who attend a university far away from their hometown. Freshmen suffer more, as it is presumably their first year away from their home, family and friends. If a student is lucky enough, he/she will make many new friends, because establishing connections and spending time with friends is important for building community. Otherwise, it will be more difficult for the student to go through the university period with all its other difficulties. University is academically challenging. The courses require much more effort and planning than high school classes. Most students do not have enough time to manage their activities. They sleep erratically and do everything at the last minute; that is what leads them to an unhealthy and unplanned life. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted, depressed and end up dropping out of university.",8.5,8.5,8.5,8.5

64,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," Studying at university will certainly be fraught with problems that students will have to deal with. In my opinion, conditions are naturally more difficult for those who study in a city other than their hometown. The most important problems of these students, in addition to the cost of education, are accommodation and homesickness. Each student has to prepare relevant books to study in any field. Fortunately, nowadays, due to the development of technology and easier access to the Internet, students are able to purchase books for free or buy them at a lower price. Students, who live in dormitories, have group life; some items such as bathroom and kitchen are shared between them, which makes it hard for some of these students to endure university life. In my opinion, living in dormitories is one of the main reasons which causes homesickness, boredom and unhappiness. For students who have left their hometown to study, it is most of the times annoying to be away from their family and friends. Just as advances in technology have minimized the enormous cost of preparing books for students, so too have advances made it possible for them to communicate with families and friends more easily than before, which mostly relieves their homesickness. University life has many problems that every student has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If a student is not strong enough to cope with such living conditions, he/she can easily become exhausted and dropping out of university is the least of the consequences.",7.5,8.0,7.5,7.5
65,What are the most important challenges or problems of university life?," Studying at university is certainly fraught with problems that students have to deal with. Starting university is like starting a new life. There are various challenges that every student inevitably struggles with during university life, which most students are not prepared for and end up being overwhelmed. In my opinion, among all these problems, difficulty in social communicating and time management are common to all students. The inability to communicate socially in a larger and newer environment than school can be the first problem which some students, especially freshmen and shy ones, face. Inability to find friends and communicate with classmates can lead to problems such as depression. For this reason, if a student takes the first step well, he/she can deal with some of the other problems more easily. Inability to manage time and use it properly is the second problem that university students often face. For many, college courses require much more effort; from trying to study to living alone and doing the required chores, most of the students are not able to manage and think about their time and do not have enough concentration due to lack of sleep because they do not have enough time to do their activities. Proper planning is the most important action that a student can take to reduce irregularities. Naturally, every student faces difficulties in university life which he/she has to deal with in order to get through his/her studies well. If the student is sufficiently prepared and strong to face problems, he will not suffer from problems. But most students who do not have the ability to overcome the problems not only become depressed but also, they end up choosing to drop out of university.",8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0
66,It is not worth going to university anymore. Do you agree or disagree? Why?," Choosing whether or not to go to university is a massive decision. It can have a huge impact on a person’s life, because one has to live with the consequences of this important decision for the rest of his/her life. Nowadays, many people accept university education, because they believe that it is an important part of becoming wealthy and successful. There are so many potential benefits that come with a college education. I, personally, believe that the most important benefits of going to university are job prospects as well as an effective development of social relations. Having a higher education degree provides people more job prospects. Those, who have the degree, are more likely to find the job they are looking for and thus grow their economy and earn money. Employers may assume a person is better qualified for higher-paying jobs if he/she has a degree even if the degree is not related to what he/she has be doing on the job. On average, people with college degrees make more than people without college degrees. University is not all about the job prospects, it is also a golden opportunity to meet new people. Being on campus, exposes people to different perspectives and ideas, and meeting people with different backgrounds and perspectives results in greater open-mindedness and a more worldview. What is special about a college environment is that you’re living with hundreds or even thousands of people who are around your age, probably for the first and only time in your life. Overall, there are so many potential benefits that come with a university education. University can be very essential towards life, because it can provide job security, better career opportunities and a stable future. It also gives people the opportunity to develop their personal and professional interests. Many students head off to school with no idea what they want to do with their lives; University gives them a chance to try out different fields. Some people even believe that it can provide the life that many people wish and dream of achieving.",8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0

University curriculums are significantly harder as compared to other educational levels, the change of pattern in university academics can stress a lot of freshmen during their examinations. On top of it, the demands for good scores, parent’s expectations, strict university admissions, etc. only increase the challenges for students. These difficulties affect the academics of the students and act as a huge challenge in their progress. Starting university is like starting a new life.
